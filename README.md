### Education
 For my Master Thesis I spent a long time building a digital controller that uses Ultrasonic Sensors where the player can move their hands in the air above the instrument and control multiple synths and effects in a modular way. I had to use 2 Arduinos to overcome the Sensor imposed time delays in the circuits. Both then connected to a SuperCollider app with a GUI to allow for further sound manipulation or standalone sound creation.

I created a track called "Y Poco A Poco" ("And Little By Little") with this Instrument which my friend later added lyrics to. Here are 2 versions, the first one where I created a video for when experiemtning with my new camera at the time. And the second version that my friend Elfyn created which is of higher quality with a better final mix and is featured on her album. She performed the song during her tour in 2024.

### Audio and Video
Like most people in the film industry, I eventually felt the need to get creative and produce my own content so I got myself some camera and lighting gear and set up to produce music videos. Here is my first ever attempt [Janos - You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9sHOheY6GU&ab_channel=Janos)

After that I upped my game and did quite a few shoots for Kelvo:

Producing, shooting and editing is incredibly time and energy consuming and doesn't pay a whole lot. I also became a full-time dad around that time so I knew I couldn't continue what was essentially a hobby at the time. It was a lot of fun though and watching my content today fills me with a sense of creative achievement as well as nostalgia.

I also still have my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/holgerhimmelblau) with songs ranging through my years of active composing. You will find an eclectic mix of music including remixes of Janos, the artist in my first video, as well as SoundDesign and Composition for Films and even some weird experimental stuff (such as me singing:).
I used to also enjoy participating in Remix contests and even won this one [Rico PÃ¼stel - Meta-Emotion (Karl Laeufers "The Illimitable Interlude" Remix)](https://www.amazon.com/Nauic-Rose-Rico-P%C3%BCstel/dp/B00FH6RQDQ)


### Sound and Audio in Film
Please refer to my old [Film Industry CV](https://github.com/kalli44100/AboutMe/blob/main/CV%20Karl%20Laeufer%202017.pdf) to get an idea of the diverse nature of projects I've worked on over the years. I even did a shoot with Ollie Murs once:)
